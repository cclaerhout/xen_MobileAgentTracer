**********************************
> This addon displays inside a message if the user used a mobile device to post it. This information can be available for posts, conversations, profile posts & profiles comments.
> This addons will use the XenForo Mobile detection (which can only detect if the user is using a mobile or a standard device). This addon will provide much more information if 
  the following addon is installed: http://xenforo.com/community/resources/browser-detection-mobile-msie.1098 
> The addon "Browser Detection (Mobile/MSIE)" is using the "Php-mobile-detect" script. With this addon, the following information will be available:
	#Tablets: BlackBerry Tablet, iPad, Kindle, Samsung Tablet, HTC tablet, Motorola Tablet, Asus Tablet, Nook Tablet, Acer Tablet, Yarvik Tablet,
		Fly Tablet, Playstation Tablet, Nabli Tablet, Nec Tablet, Huawei Tablet, Bq Tablet
	#Mobiles: iPhone, BlackBerry, HTC, Nexus, DellStreak, Motorola, Samsung, Sony, Asus, Palm, Fly
> If the script "Php-mobile-detect" can't detect precisely the device, it will return "Tablet" or "Mobile". If a new tablet is available and hasn't yet been integrated inside this script,
  it will still return "mobile". Of course all these information are provided by the useragent which can be bypassed.
> Admin can allow users to enable/disable the recording of their mobile device information (inside user privacy settings) - Admin should check their country regulation about it
> Admin can allow users to delete their recorded mobile device information (inside user privacy settings) - Admin should check their country regulation about it
